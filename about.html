            <p>Memory Palace is the ongoing project of artist Fraser Scowen. Taking inspiration from various fields of thought, art and design.
            <p>The project is split into visual works constructed in many different mediums, which present abstractions of memories and of time.</p>
            <p>The other part encompassing audio experiments and recorded sound works, with a focus on process, patterns in repetition and experience of sound relative to time.</p>
            <p>Other ongoing works include development of a theory for a philosophic approach to modular synthesis and creating collections of visual art works and prints.</p>
