(WORK IN PROGRESS)

This is ongoing project that will be designed as an artist portfolio, showcasing a body of work that include various paintings and sketches by Northampton based artist, Fraser Scowan.

At the moment I have a simple homepage with a minimalistic style, alongside an 'About' page that follows the same theme.
I have yet to upload the paintings which will be displayed across three separate pages, with a 'Contact' page that will use a userform for user input.
